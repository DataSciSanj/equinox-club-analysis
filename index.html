            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to explore the demographic, income, and housing characteristics of households in zip codes where Equinox clubs are located. By leveraging U.S. Census ACS data, we can better understand the socio-economic profiles of these areas, providing valuable insights for strategic planning and market positioning.

            <h2>Initial Data Cleaning and Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps, including the imputation of missing values, data normalization, and standardization. These steps were essential to ensure the accuracy of subsequent analyses. Challenges included handling outliers and ensuring consistency across different data sources.

            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
            <h3>Histograms of Key Numerical Variables</h3>
            <p>
                We explored the distribution of key numerical variables such as median age, household income, and monthly housing costs. The analysis revealed that homeowners in these areas tend to belong to higher income brackets, while renters generally fall into lower income categories.

            <p class="insight">
                <strong>Insight:</strong> Homeowners show a trend towards higher economic status, while renters are clustered at the lower end of the income scale.

            <h3>Geographical Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The state-level analysis showed significant variations in income levels across different regions. States like Illinois and New York stood out with higher median household incomes, particularly among homeowners, suggesting these are key markets for Equinox.

            <h3>Age and Income Relationship</h3>
            <p>
                We investigated the relationship between age and income and found weak correlations, indicating that age is not a strong predictor of income within these zip codes.

            <h2>Potential Future Analyses</h2>
            <p>
                Future analyses could delve deeper into cluster analysis, examining the distribution of income and housing costs across different segments. We could also explore geographical trends at a more granular city or neighborhood level to uncover more localized patterns.

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p class="insight">
                <strong>Data Constraints:</strong> The analysis was constrained by the availability of publicly accessible data. Incorporating internal Equinox data could significantly enhance the findings.
            </p>
            <p class="insight">
                <strong>Granularity:</strong> State-level analysis provided broad insights, but more detailed city or neighborhood-level data would offer more precise targeting capabilities.
            </p>
            <p class="insight">
                <strong>Time-Series Analysis:</strong> A longitudinal study could reveal trends over time but was outside the scope due to data limitations.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The findings suggest that Equinox clubs are primarily located in higher-income areas, with homeowners representing a significant portion of the target demographic. These insights can guide future marketing and expansion efforts. For a more comprehensive analysis, integrating internal data with external datasets will be crucial.
