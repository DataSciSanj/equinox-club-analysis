            <h2>Introduction & Objective</h2>
            <p>
                We analyze demographic, economic, and housing characteristics of current Equinox club locations to identify patterns that could inform future site selection. Despite not having access to internal usage data, the goal is to demonstrate how external data might provide insights into potential new locations.

            <h2>Data Description and Collection</h2>
            <h3>Equinox Data</h3>
            <p>
                Equinox fitness, part of the Equinox Group, is a subsidiary of privately-held real estate firm The Related Companies. Internal data such as same-store revenues, membership, retention, etc., are not publicly available. The limitations presented by the lack of such data to a more thorough analysis are discussed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scope of Equinox-related data used in this analysis is restricted to location information available on their website. This provided the names, addresses, phone numbers, and amenities for each club. Of particular note for analytical purposes, was the inclusion of ZIP codes, which were used to join club records to external data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Equinox club location data was collected with a web scraping script built using the BeautifulSoup library in Python, resulting in an initial Equinox location dataset of 114 clubs.

        <section class="data-summary">
            <h2>Equinox Club Locations - Summary and Focus</h2>
            <p>
                After collecting the data on Equinox club locations, we found the following key statistics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Number of Clubs:</strong> 114</li>
                <li><strong>Number of Clubs in the UK:</strong> 3</li>
                <li><strong>Number of Clubs in Canada:</strong> 3</li>
                <li><strong>Number of Clubs in the US:</strong> 108</li>
                <li><strong>Number of Location Regions in the US:</strong> 13</li>
                <li><strong>Number of States Represented:</strong> 14</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                For our analysis, we focus exclusively on the clubs in the United States, where there are 108 clubs across 14 states, 56 cities, and 94 zip codes. These clubs will be examined as model profiles to glean insights into the demographic, economic, and household data of the areas they are located in.

        <section class="external-data">
            <h2>External Data/Market Data/Demo, Econ, Housing/Socio-Economic Data</h2>
            <p>
                Data pertaining to the demographic, economic, income, and housing characteristics of locations where Equinox clubs are located were sourced from the U.S. Census. This analysis focuses on the most recent year's (2022) demographic, income, and housing data estimates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following datasets were primarily leveraged in the analysis presented here:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>American Community Survey 2022: 5-Year Estimates S0101 | Age and Sex</strong></li>
                <li><strong>American Community Survey 2022: 5-Year Estimates S1903 | Median Income in the Past 12 Months</strong></li>
                <li><strong>American Community Survey 2022: 5-Year Estimates S2503 | Financial Characteristics</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These files were downloaded directly from the Census Bureau's data website after being filtered to ensure the output files provided ZIP code level data.

        <section class="data-preparation">
            <h2>Data Cleaning and Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                For this analysis, the initial data cleaning steps involved handling missing values in the <code>eqnx_with_census_data.csv</code> file. We began by filtering out non-US records and addressing missing values in numeric columns using a median imputation strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                After these steps, the dataset was cleaned and ready for further analysis, with non-numeric NaNs preserved for potential categorical analysis.

        <section class="correlation-analysis">
            <h3>Correlation Analysis: Key Factors</h3>
            <p>
                We performed a correlation analysis to identify the strongest relationships between demographic and economic factors at Equinox locations. The following insights were derived:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Household Costs and Family Income:</strong> Strong correlations were observed between household costs and family income, indicating that Equinox locations are typically found in wealthier areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Population and Family Size:</strong> The population count is strongly correlated with the number of families and individuals, suggesting that Equinox locations are in denser, family-oriented areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Household Occupancy and Income:</strong> Higher household occupancy rates are associated with higher incomes, further supporting the idea that Equinox locations are in affluent neighborhoods.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="hypothesis-testing">
            <h3>Hypothesis Testing: Median Income</h3>
            <p>
                To determine if the median income at Equinox locations is significantly different from the national median income, we conducted a Mann-Whitney U test. This non-parametric test was chosen due to the lack of variance in the national income data, which made a t-test unreliable.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Mann-Whitney U Test Results:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>U-Statistic:</strong> 99.0</li>
                <li><strong>P-Value:</strong> 0.1547</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The p-value indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the median income at Equinox locations and the national median income.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="gender-analysis">
            <h3>Gender-Based Income Analysis</h3>
            <p>We explored the income differences between males and females at Equinox locations compared to the state averages.</p>

            <h4>1. Male Median Income: Equinox Locations vs. State Averages</h4>

            <img src="boxplot_female_income.png" alt="Female Median Income: Equinox Locations vs. State Averages">

            <h4>Key Insights</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statistically Significant Differences:</strong> Both males and females at Equinox locations have significantly higher median incomes compared to the state averages, as shown by the Mann-Whitney U test results.</li>
                <li>The income levels at Equinox locations underscore the club's presence in affluent areas, with both genders earning more compared to state averages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Hypothesis Testing Results</h4>
            <p>We conducted Mann-Whitney U tests to assess the significance of the income differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Male Income:</strong> U-Statistic: 661.0, P-Value: \(1.28 \times 10^{-6}\)</li>
                <li><strong>Female Income:</strong> U-Statistic
                <li><strong>Female Income:</strong> U-Statistic: \(6.60 \times 10^{-8}\)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both tests confirm that the income differences between Equinox locations and state averages are statistically significant for both males and females.</p>
