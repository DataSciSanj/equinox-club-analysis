    <h1>Equinox Club Analysis: Demographic and Financial Insights</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Equinox Club Analysis project, where we explore the distribution and characteristics of Equinox clubs across various locations, analyzing demographic and financial data to uncover patterns and insights.</p>

    <h2>Data Overview</h2>
    <h3>Datasets Used</h3>
    <p>This analysis uses data scraped from the Equinox website, combined with demographic data sourced from the U.S. Census and ACS.</p>

    <h3>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>The data was cleaned to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats. Outliers in income data were treated to prevent skewing the analysis.</p>
