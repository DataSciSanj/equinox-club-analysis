            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Brief overview of the project objectives. Description of the dataset: demographics, income, and geographical details related to areas where Equinox clubs are located.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2>Initial Data Cleaning and Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                Summary of the data cleaning steps taken: imputation of missing values, standardization, and normalization of data where necessary. Any challenges encountered during data cleaning.
            </p>

            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
            <h3>Histograms of Key Numerical Variables</h3>
            <p>
                Analysis of the distributions for median ages (both male and female), household income, owned household income, and monthly housing costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Insights:</span> Median household income for owned homes shows a spread towards higher income ranges, indicating a higher economic bracket for homeowners in these areas. Renters' median household income is more clustered towards the lower end, suggesting a different economic demographic compared to homeowners.
            </p>
            <div class="plot">

            <h3>Geographical Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                State-Level Income Analysis: Median household income, owned household income, and renter household income were analyzed across states.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Key Observations:</span> Certain states like IL and NY have higher median owned household incomes, suggesting these might be key markets for Equinox. Renter household income shows less variability across states but highlights the economic differences in renting vs. owning a home.
            </p>

            <h3>Age and Income Relationship</h3>
            <p>
                Correlation Analysis: Weak correlations were found between age (both male and female) and income variables, suggesting that age is not a strong predictor of income in these regions.

            <h2>Potential Future Analyses</h2>
            <p>
                Cluster Analysis: Can analyze the clusters in more detail by examining the distribution of other features such as household income, occupied household income, and owned household income across different clusters.
            </p>
            <p>
                We might also want to explore different pairs of features to see if other combinations reveal more distinct patterns between clusters. Exploring the clustering results in the context of geographical differences or age and income relationships might also yield interesting insights.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">External Data Constraints:</span> The analysis was limited to publicly available data. Internal Equinox data on memberships, revenue, and specific marketing campaigns could provide deeper insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Geographical Granularity:</span> While state-level analysis was insightful, more detailed city or neighborhood-level data would allow for more precise targeting and understanding of local markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Time-Series Analysis:</span> A longitudinal analysis could reveal trends over time, but this was outside the scope due to data limitations.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Summary of key findings and their implications for Equinox. Suggestions for strategic focus based on the data, such as targeting high-income homeowners or expanding in regions with growing rental populations. Final thoughts on the importance of integrating internal data for a more comprehensive understanding.
